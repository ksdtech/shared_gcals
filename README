shared_gcals

Shell program to test Google Calendar API 
ACLs and CalendarList resources.

OAuth code copied from gdrive-cli application
by Thomas Dignan <tom@tomdignan.com>

Moved some of his code into oauth module, and refactored it to make it 
generic for API scopes, discovery services and versions.
